*Inspired means that i have seen this **brilliant project**, started to use them
and than started to write my own version with the intention to just have the
functionality i really use.  
I got the idea of how things are working by analyzing and using the code of
it and i can't say where i used snippets from this project but they've
influenced my code strongly.
